# Facialaffectrecognition

This repository improvises on previous work done on the Facial recognition challenge using the Extended CK+ Database. This contains various models and architectures to find the validation and training accuracies and thereby allowing to compare the results. We also incorporate the Squeeze and Excitation network to eke out further accuracies. 
This also contains the visualisation of data and a code to visualise individual steps and the features that are obtained by them. 
It can be used for a personalised code too.
